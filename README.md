# Matlab-Image-Proccesing-HSV-RGB-Operations

Consider the “autumn.jpg” image. You can use MATLAB's histeq function in this problem.          
(a) Display the R, G, and B components of the image.                       
(b) Histogram equalize separately the R, G, and B images and then put them together. Display the resulting image.                 
(c) Convert the original image to HSV space using rgb2hsv. Histogram equalize the Value component only, convert back to RGB using hsv2rgb, and display the result.       
(d) Histogram equalize the Saturation component only, convert back to RGB, and display the result.          


Using MATLAB, generate a color image of size 300x300 where Hue is equal to 1 throughout the image. Let the Value component linearly increase from 0 to 1 from left to right, and the Saturation component increase from 0 to 1 from top to bottom.              
(a) Convert the image into RGB space and display it in your homework report.            
(b) Describe what happens as the value and saturation components vary in the image.          
(c) Find and report the RGB values at pixel locations (1, 20), (1,150), (1, 250). Check the appearance of the color at those pixels. Comment.          
(d) Find and report the RGB values at pixel locations (20, 1), (150,1), (250, 1). Check the appearance of the color at those pixels. Comment.
